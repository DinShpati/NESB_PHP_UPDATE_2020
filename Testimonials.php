               <p class="comfortaa"><b>Sandra wrote this about our shea butter:</b><br>
                “I have only good things to say about your product, Shea Butter. I have tried so many different products that are full of promises.  Since trying Shea Butter, I finally found a product that does do what it promises. My skin feels softer, moister, and I can use it around my eyes and even on my eyelids with no harmful effects.  That's because your product is "pure".  It is so difficult to find a pure product any more and to find one that works is even more remarkable.

                I had the worst problem with dry skin on the bottom of my feet. I tried everything but nothing helped until I tried Shea Butter. Within one week, ALL of the dry skin had healed. Now that's a miracle! I've since bought jars of it for my sisters who tried some of mine and were so excited at how great it made their skin feel.”

                <b>Craig wrote this about our Raw African Black Soap:</b><br>
                “Yesterday I was in the store buying some Nubian Heritage Soap, and the gentleman in the store recommended the raw black soap.  I used it last night and this morning on my face.  That stuff is great!!  Thank you!! I have dry skin and I've never been able to use "soap" on my face because it completely strips it and makes it very dry.  The black soap cleaned thoroughly, but left my face feeling fantastic!
                <br>I took the person's advice and cut it in half.  I can tell this is a smart move because the lather is unbelievable, and I'm sure it won't last long in the shower.  Again, thanks for the tip!  I'm looking forward to using something natural, effective, and inexpensive on my face instead of the pricey, chemical-laden, facial cleansers I've had to use in past.<br><br>

                “I am extremely pleased with the shea butter that I previously purchased at the 'Big E' in 2009 and regret that I didn't get around to ordering more sooner. Thank you for the wonderful products and the great customer service!<br><br>
                
                <b>Jessi sent this in about our Buzz Off:</b><br>
                "Thank you so much for this  product!! I used it once at work and didn't think it worked because I was still bothered. However, yesterday and today I applied more to my arms,
                legs and neck and I didn't get a single bug bite, nor was I bothered by pesky mosquitoes. I work as a gardener at a private estate, so I do a lot of various jobs in various areas including a large garden and the woods. Today my day started without this product and I was being attacked by mosquitoes.  So, I applied a liberal amount of Buzz Off to my skin, anything that was showing. And for the rest of the day, I had no problems with the bugs. I didn't have to reapply even after it rained. Also, it doesn't smell bad, just like a citronella candle and it feels nice on the skin."<br><br>
                
                <b>We just received this email from Linda:</b><br>
                "I sincerely appreciate your immediate response to my request for “yellow” Shea Butter.  I am so grateful that you took my plea for help seriously and surprised me by sending the package Priority Mail.  Your customer service is unmatched!  This product has enabled me to reduce my Rosacea medication by 50%, once I began using it several years ago.  Thank you again – Linda<br>
                
                <b>Cindra (The Avon Representative) said:</b><br>
                "Hi,I just wanted to let you know that I purchased a small jar of your Shea Butter, at the Horse Expo in Timonium, MD, and I loved it!  It made my dry feet feel & look better overnight!  It stopped the itching of eczema on my foot as well.  I needed a product without fragrance.  Avon's products have some Shea Butter, but they also contain fragrance & other ingredients which does not help the eczema.  I will use the insect repellent Shea Butter this coming summer".<br><br>
                
                <b>Melissa explains about her experience with Shea Butter for her Psoriasis:</b><br>
                "Hi I bought the Shea butter at the Big E and you said it would help psoriasis. I have tried every over the counter ointment with no luck. The shea butter works!!!!!<br>
                I am 75% cleared up just in the last 6 months !! <br>
                thank you ! :)<br>

                <b>Sherri explains how our Shea Butter helps her with Scleroderma symptoms:</b><br>
                "I bought 2 16 oz containers at the Big E and used every single drop of both. I had spoke to you that I believe i have a autoimmune disease called scleroderma which hardens the skin. I believe i am at the beginning stages of this disease and this has been so wonderful as it is all natural and no scent or ingredients and is very thick and due to this disease it absorbs so quickly but helps so much with the symptoms……..thank you so very much for your product. and I look forward to the next 2 containers." <br><br>
                
                <b>Gloria says:</b><br>
                Hi. I attended the Apple Harvest Festival in Southington, Ct. The
                first weekend of October and was pleased to sample the shea butter at
                your booth. The salesman was charming and very knowledgeable about
                the product. I bought a small container of the yellow shea butter and
                a bar of the black african soap and I am very pleased with these two
                products. Within two days, the shea butter had cleared up a small rash
                that I had under my nose ( think it was dermatitis) and the black
                african soap has been a great body cleanser. I did break the bar in
                two since a small piece goes a long way. I will definitely buy more
                of this product as soon as I start to get low. Thank you for
                introducing both to me.<br>
